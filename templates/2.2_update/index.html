        <p>A planet is a collection of posts from many different blogs, all somewhat related to one topic. It's a great way to keep tabs on a subject, a community, a technology, a team, a project or anything else that attracts a diverse range of bloggers.</p>
	<p><b>Community</b>. Planets are a great way to focus and foster community. It's easy to get everybody in the community talking with each other when you're all reading each other's blogs!</p>
	<p><b>Curation</b>. One-stop curation allows a planet to become the definitive collection of news about a topic. Each planet is a feed that can be imported into an RSS reader. Planets allow you to pull together the best blogs about a topic so others don't have to do the leg work. And you can get your entire audience reading the newest blogs simply by updating the planet.</p>

	<p><b>Early News</b>. Many planets collect the personal blogs of the people who work on a project. Often the interesting developments that will eventually become front-page news on a project start as small personal milestones. If you want to know where a project is going, watch its planet. That's where all the early action is.</p>
